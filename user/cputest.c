// cputest: cross-check per-process CPU time accounting against the
// global uptime clock.
//
// The kernel charges one timer tick to whichever process it interrupted,
// splitting user from supervisor time by sstatus.SPP.  We verify both
// halves from user space:
//
//   phase 1 (user-heavy): spin in user mode, almost no syscalls
//                         -> user ticks should track elapsed
//   phase 2 (sys-heavy):  hammer the heavy psinfo() syscall
//                         -> sys ticks should dominate elapsed
//
// uptime() counts ticks on hart 0 only, while we may be scheduled on any
// hart, so a little skew is expected -- the point is to print the
// discrepancy, not to hide it.
